# ResNet18 with SE Block for ECG Classification

This project implements a modified ResNet18 model enhanced with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks for the classification of 12-lead ECG signals. The goal is to improve the modelâ€™s performance on the PTB-XL dataset for automatic diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions.
git clone https://github.com/NasimBigzadeh/ResNet18-SeNet.git
cd ResNet18-SeNet
### ðŸ“Š Example of Usage

After running the notebook, the model will be trained on ECG data and the classification results will be printed like this:

          precision    recall  f1-score   support

   CD       0.89      0.72      0.80       184  
  HYP       0.71      0.54      0.61        56  
   MI       0.80      0.60      0.69       256  
 NORM       0.89      0.99      0.94       912  
 STTC       0.73      0.76      0.75       242
